# tiago-autonomous-mapping
This repository contains a Python controller for the Tiago robot in Webots. The robot navigates predefined waypoints around a table while mapping its environment with Lidar. After completing a full loop, it generates a configuration space (c-space) and visualizes it with Matplotlib.
